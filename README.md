Study of Chest XRays for classification of thoracic diseases

This project was maintained on Google drive throughout its timeline for easy access to datasets and code while using Google colab.

We used NIH X-rays dataset which consists of X-rays corresponding to 14 different types of thoracic diseases. You can find the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) also.

The trained models, weights and corresponding datasets created and used are present on personal drive.
